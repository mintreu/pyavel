### 🚀 Introduction

**Pyavel** is a modern, lightweight Python framework inspired by **Laravel**. It gives you structure, flexibility, and power — without the overhead.  
Built for developers who want to code fast, stay organized, and love Laravel-style architecture.

### 🧠 Philosophy

> **“Pyavel is not just a framework — it's Bramha, the code creator.”**  
Just like Laravel in PHP, Pyavel helps you manage routes, controllers, helpers, and services in Python — all structured in a modular, readable, and extensible way.
